<!-- 
    The issue faced now is that, express is unable to find the static CSS folder, so no design was being passed to the page.
    Thus, using another middleware we tell Express to pick our CSS static file from the Public folder
    After this download page is done we have to make this download button link work and start our download.
    Thus, for that we have to make a new route and declare it in the server.js file.
